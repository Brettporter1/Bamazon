### Bamazon Customer

Launching the customer side you will be prompt to answer two questions:

* The product you would like to purchase (You can enter in either id number or product name).
* The quantity of that particular product you would like to purchase. 

Once it varifies the product and the amount it will complete the purchase and give you the total cost and then ask if you would like to purchase anything else. 

If the quantity requested is more that the available stock, you will be notified about the insufficient amount and will be asked if you would like to buy anything else.
